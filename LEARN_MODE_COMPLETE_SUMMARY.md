## 🎯 Stage 1: Listen & Shadow (COMPLETE)

### Features Implemented:

**✅ Real Audio**:
- CDN recitation (Maher Al-Muaiqly)
- Word-level timing segments
- Instant word highlighting (no animation lag)
- Never skips words

**✅ Speech Recognition**:
- Web Speech API (ar-SA Arabic)
- Validates actual words spoken
- Text similarity scoring (Levenshtein distance)
- Multiple alternative checking
- Graceful fallback to VAD if not supported

**✅ Dynamic Progress**:
- 95-100% match = +40% (Perfect)
- 80-94% match = +30% (Good)
- 60-79% match = +20% (Fair)
- <60% match = +10% (Poor)

**✅ Auto-Loop**:
- Audio → Record → Validate → Play again
- Continues until progress = 100%
- No manual clicking needed

**✅ Playback Speed Control**:
- Settings gear icon (top-right corner)
- Slider: 0.5x to 1.5x
- Quick presets: 0.75x, 1.0x, 1.25x
- Perfect for slower learning

**✅ Fixed Layout**:
- Settings in top-right corner
- Status indicators at bottom (reserved space)
- No shifting when components appear
- Stable, professional UI

**✅ Spacebar Controls**:
- SPACE = Play audio
- SPACE (during audio) = Restart audio
- SPACE (during recording) = Stop loop

## 📊 Quality Metrics

### Text Validation:
```typescript
1. Normalize both texts (remove diacritics)
2. Calculate Levenshtein distance
3. Convert to similarity score (0-1)
4. Determine quality grade
5. Add corresponding progress
```

### Example Validation:
```
Expected:  قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ
After normalization: قل هو الله احد

User says: "قل هو الله احد"
Recognized: قل هو الله احد
Similarity: 100%
Quality: Perfect
Progress: +40%
```

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Services Created:

**1. `recitationService.ts`**:
- Load audio URLs from JSON
- Get word timing segments
- Create audio players
- Track current word during playback

**2. `speechRecognitionService.ts`**:
- Web Speech API wrapper
- Arabic text normalization
- Levenshtein distance algorithm
- Similarity calculation
- Quality scoring

### Integration:

**LearnAyahView.tsx**:
- Speech recognition for Listen & Shadow
- Real audio playback with word sync
- Dynamic progress calculation
- Auto-loop system
- Playback speed control
- Fixed layout (no shifts)
- Comprehensive logging

## 📱 Browser Requirements

### For Full Experience:
- Chrome/Edge (best Arabic speech recognition)
- HTTPS or localhost
- Microphone permission
- Internet connection (for speech-to-text)

### Fallback (If Speech Recognition Unavailable):
- Uses VAD (Voice Activity Detection)
- Detects voice presence only
- Progress based on duration/segments
- Still functional, less accurate

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Layout Structure:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                   [⚙️]      │  ← Settings (top-right)
│                                             │
│         قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ              │  ← Arabic (centered)
│         qul huwa llāhu aḥad                │  ← Transliteration
│                                             │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ 🔴 Recording your recitation...       │ │  ← Status (bottom, fixed)
│  └───────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  Progress: ████████████░░░░░░░░  60%
  [SPACE] to play audio
```

### No More Shifting!
- Fixed height container (400px)
- Reserved space for status (h-10)
- Settings absolutely positioned
- Spacebar indicator smart hiding

## 🔍 Comprehensive Logging

### All Log Categories:

| Icon | Category | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 🎤 | Speech Recognition | Recognition events |
| 📝 | Text Comparison | What was said vs expected |
| 📊 | Similarity Score | Match percentage |
| 🎯 | Alternatives | Multiple interpretations |
| ✅ | Best Match | Final selection |
| 📈 | Progress Update | How much added |
| 🔄 | Auto-Loop | Replay trigger |
| ⌨️ | Spacebar | User input |
| 🔊 | Audio | Playback events |
| 🎵 | Word Highlight | Current word |

### Debug Process:

1. Open console (F12)
2. Start learn session
3. Press SPACE and recite
4. Watch logs show:
   - What was recognized
   - How it compared
   - Why that progress was added

## 🚀 Next: Read & Recite

Same speech recognition logic can be applied to:

**Read & Recite Stage**:
- Continuous speech recognition mode
- Validates each recitation
- Shows which words matched
- Underlines current word being validated
- Builds progress with each good recitation

**Implementation approach**:
```typescript
// Start continuous recognition
recognition.continuous = true;

// As user recites repeatedly
recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  const transcript = getBestAlternative(event);
  const similarity = calculateSimilarity(transcript, expectedText);
  
  // Each good recitation adds progress
  if (similarity > 0.8) {
    addProgress(30);
  }
  
  // Underline words being said
  updateCurrentWord(transcript);
};
```

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### To Verify It's Working:

1. ✅ Open browser console

3. ✅ Skip to āyah intro
4. ✅ Click "Start Learning"
5. ✅ Look for: `✓ [Speech Recognition] Supported and enabled`
6. ✅ Press SPACE
7. ✅ Listen to audio
8. ✅ When recording starts, recite the āyah
9. ✅ Look for: `📝 [Text Comparison]` with your words
10. ✅ Look for: `📊 [Similarity Score]` showing match %
11. ✅ Look for: `📈 [Progress Update]` with increment
12. ✅ Verify progress bar fills
13. ✅ Verify audio plays again automatically

### If Speech Recognition Not Working:

Check console for:
```
⚠️ [Speech Recognition] Not supported
→ Browser doesn't support it (use Chrome)

❌ [Speech Recognition] Error: not-allowed
→ Grant microphone permission

⚠️ [Fallback] Using VAD instead
→ Will use voice detection only
```

## 🎓 What We've Built
