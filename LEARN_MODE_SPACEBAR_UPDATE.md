# Learn Mode - Spacebar Flow & Dynamic Progress Update ⌨️

## 🚀 What's New

Complete redesign of the learning interaction model with spacebar controls, dynamic progress, automatic transitions, and encouragement animations.

## ⌨️ Spacebar-Driven Flow

### The Single Key Experience

**No more manual button clicking!** Everything is now controlled with the **SPACEBAR** for a smooth, intuitive flow.

### How It Works

#### 🎵 Listen & Shadow Stage
1. User presses **SPACE**
2. Audio plays automatically
3. After audio finishes, recording starts automatically
4. User recites the āyah
5. System validates and adds dynamic progress
6. When progress = 100% → Auto-advance with encouragement animation
7. Repeat: Press **SPACE** again for next attempt

#### 📖 Read & Recite Stage
1. User presses **SPACE**
2. Recording starts immediately
3. User recites while viewing text
4. System validates and adds dynamic progress
5. When progress = 100% → Auto-advance with encouragement animation
6. Repeat: Press **SPACE** again for next attempt

#### 🧠 Recall from Memory Stage
1. User presses **SPACE**
2. Recording starts (all words hidden)
3. Words appear as user recites them
4. After completing all words, system adds progress
5. When progress = 100% → Āyah mastered!
6. Repeat: Press **SPACE** again for next attempt

## 📊 Dynamic Progress System

### Quality-Based Progress Increment

Progress is NO LONGER fixed at 33% per attempt. It's now **dynamic** based on recitation quality:

| Quality | Hesitations | Mistakes | Progress Added |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Perfect** | 0 | 0 | **40%** |
| **Good** | ≤ 1 | ≤ 1 | **30%** |
| **Fair** | ≤ 2 | ≤ 2 | **20%** |
| **Poor** | > 2 | > 2 | **10%** |

### What This Means

- **Perfect recitations** fill the bar faster (3 perfect = 120% = Done!)
- **Good recitations** still progress well (4 good = 120% = Done!)
- **Fair/poor attempts** require more practice (5-10 attempts)
- System adapts to user's performance level

## ✨ Automatic Stage Transitions

### Encouragement Animations

When a stage reaches 100% progress:

1. **2-second full-screen encouragement** appears
2. Random motivational message shown:
   - "Mashallah! 🌟"
   - "You're doing great!"
   - "Keep it up! 💪"
   - "You're on a roll!"
   - "Excellent progress!"
   - "Beautiful recitation! ✨"
3. **Automatic transition** to next stage
4. No button clicking needed!

### Visual Design

- Full-screen overlay with backdrop blur
- Large, bold text (6xl-7xl)
- Animated pulse effect
- "Moving to next stage..." subtitle
- Smooth fade in/out

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### State Variables
```typescript
const [stage, setStage] = useState<LearnStage>('ayah-intro');
const [stageProgress, setStageProgress] = useState(0); // 0-100
const [isWaitingForSpace, setIsWaitingForSpace] = useState(true);
const [showEncouragement, setShowEncouragement] = useState(false);
const [encouragementMessage, setEncouragementMessage] = useState('');
const [audioPlaying, setAudioPlaying] = useState(false);
const [isReciting, setIsReciting] = useState(false);
const [revealedWords, setRevealedWords] = useState<number>(-1);
```

### Progress Calculation
```typescript
let progressIncrement = 10; // Default (poor)
if (hesitations === 0 && mistakeCount === 0) {
  progressIncrement = 40; // Perfect
} else if (hesitations <= 1 && mistakeCount <= 1) {
  progressIncrement = 30; // Good
} else if (hesitations <= 2 && mistakeCount <= 2) {
  progressIncrement = 20; // Fair
}

setStageProgress(prev => Math.min(prev + progressIncrement, 100));
```

### Spacebar Handler
```typescript
const handleSpacebarPress = useCallback(() => {
  if (showEncouragement || !isWaitingForSpace) return;
  
  if (stage === 'listen-shadow') {
    playAudio(); // Then auto-records
  } else if (stage === 'read-recite') {
    startRecitation();
  } else if (stage === 'recall-memory') {
    setRevealedWords(-1);
    startListening();
  }
}, [stage, isWaitingForSpace, showEncouragement]);
```

### Auto-Advance Logic
```typescript
if (newProgress >= 100) {
  setEncouragementMessage(getRandomEncouragement());
  setShowEncouragement(true);
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    setShowEncouragement(false);
    // Transition to next stage
    setStage(nextStage);
    setStageProgress(0);
  }, 2000);
}
```

  setIsReciting(true);
  startListening();
};
```
