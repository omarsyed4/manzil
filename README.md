## Testing the App

1. **Open** `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Create a plan** - Click "Choose Surah & Start"
3. **Select a surah** - Pick from the available options
4. **Set target date** - Choose when you want to complete it
5. **View Today page** - See your plan summary and start button
6. **Navigate** - Test the Progress and Settings pages

## Firebase Data Init and Rules

### Initialize Surah 114 (An-Nas)

We seed a minimal, public dataset for Surah An-Nas using transliterations only, with nested structure:

- `surahs/114`
- `surahs/114/ayahs/{1..6}`
- `surahs/114/ayahs/{n}/words/{m}` with `letters: [{ i, ch }]`

Run once (from app code or console):

```ts
import { initializeDatabase } from './src/lib/seedData';
initializeDatabase();
```

### Firestore Rules

- `surahs/*` and nested subcollections: public read, no writes
- `users/{uid}` and nested subcollections: private to that `uid`

See `firestore.rules`.

## Next Steps

The simplified foundation is complete. Next priorities:

1. **Session Director** - Implement the autopilot session flow
2. **Audio System** - Add Quranic audio playback with crossfade
3. **Microphone Integration** - Voice activity detection for timing
4. **SRS Algorithm** - Spaced repetition scheduling
5. **Progress Tracking** - Charts and finish date predictions
